  - start with an html file
  - design the Report
  - mock up at least a section for three/four instructors
  - Turn this into an ERB file (template.html.erb)
  - Report code should:
    - read the file from disk into a string `string = File.read`
    - turn that string into an ERB object `template = ERB.new(string)`
    - Let ERB do it's `magic` of merging: `output = template.result(binding)`
